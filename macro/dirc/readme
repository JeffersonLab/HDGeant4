Example of the workflow:

Use dirc_rd branch for HDDS (https://github.com/JeffersonLab/hdds).

Set particle generator/source by using control.in file.

#run simulation:
hdgeant4 run.mac

# convert .hddm output to root format:
hd_root -o drc.root --plugin=pid_dirc out.hddm

# plot DIRC's hit pattern:
root loadlib.C drawHP.C'("drc.root")'


For a GUI with 3D visualization one need to have OpenGl and Qt libraries installed.
Also -DG4UI_USE_EXECUTIVE flag needs to be added in GNUmakefile

# === LUT creation ===
put  "DIRCLUT 1" derective into control.in
#run
hdgeant4 -t1 run.mac
# with about 100k in run.mac

#create LUT with lut_dirc plugin:
hd_root -nthreads=10-o lut.root --plugin=lut_dirc out.hddm
