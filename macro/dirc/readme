Example of the workflow:

Set particle generator/source by using control.in file

#run simulation:
hdgeant4 run.mac

# convert .hddm output to root format:
hd_root -o drc.root --plugin=pid_dirc out.hddm

# plot DIRC's hit pattern:
root loadlib.C drawHP.C'("drc.root")'


For a GUI with 3D visualization one need to have OpenGl and Qt libraries installed.
Also -DG4UI_USE_EXECUTIVE flag needs to be added in GNUmakefile
